Connect
=======
To build end to end blockchain solutions, there is a need to connect with participants in a manner of different ways.

For example, in a supply chain scenario for cocoa, the following interfaces can be required -

__SMS and voice__ interfaces enable small hold farmers in Africa to transact and track their goods at the first mile of the supply chain.

__Internet of Things (IoT)__ devices deliver sensor data to track the conditions of the goods at different points in their journey to market – tracking the humidity in the containers where the beans are held to the temperature of the end product of ice cream that it is incorporated into.

__Mobile__ clients enable logistics providers to accept and transfer responsibility for products on their journey from manufacturer to retail using the compute power that already exists in the pockets of its employees. Mobile devices also have sensors such as GPS and cameras that can add complementary data that can help attest to the what, where, and when of deliveries.

__Backend Systems__ and Data in the form of ERP systems such as Dynamics and SAP are used to manage core processes for different participants. These systems also become clients via extension and need to interact with smart contracts to provide and receive attestable data on behalf of an organization.

__Bots and assistants__ enable manufacturers and retailers to interact with the supply chain. This includes interacting with smart contracts for orders and provenance using natural language and using attestable data from the blockchain to direct actions taken on behalf of a user.

__Web clients__ enable end consumers to query the origin of the product purchased at retail, typically a mix of provenance and story of their journey of their product from “farm to fork”

This section of the development kit provides samples on how to deliver these interfaces.
