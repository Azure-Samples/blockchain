Mobile clients enable end users to leverage the computing power that is already in their pockets. It can communicate, collect information from users, and can also use embedded sensors for image, audio, and GPS to provide more context.

For example, in a supply chain scenario mobile enable logistics providers to accept and transfer responsibility for products on their journey from manufacturer to retail using the compute power that already exists in the pockets of its employees. Mobile devices also have sensors sch as GPS and cameras that can add complementary data that can help attest to the what, where, and when of deliveries.
