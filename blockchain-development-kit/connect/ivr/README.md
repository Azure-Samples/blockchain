Voice Samples
=============

In certain scenarios, the best way to connect with a participant in a transaction is by phone. SMS is one way to do this, but may not be ideal for certain types of communication and data collection. In those cases, it's desirable to provide audio details and interact via voice.

This section includes samples for integrated voice response (IVR). 

Samples related to bots and assistants (Alexa, Cortana, etc.) can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain/tree/master/blockchain-development-kit/connect/bots-and-assistants).
