Bots And Assistants
===================
Bots and assistants are increasingly being adopted for interacting with smart contracts for orders and provenance using natural language and using attestable data from the blockchain to direct actions taken on behalf of a user.

This section of the development toolkit includes samples for popular bots and assistant frameworks.  Samples support Azure Blockchain Workbench and Logic App Connectors for Blockchain.

Amazon Alexa
-------------
In this sample, an Alexa Skill is created and connected to a logic app.  The logic app then creates a contract on a blockchain that represents the item to be put up for sale.

Corda Ledger Connector for Logic Apps Sample (Coming Soon)

Cortana
-------
In this sample, an Azure Bot Service is created that is set up with a channel for Cortana. It is connected to a logic app that creates a contract on a blockchain that represents the item to be put up for sale.
