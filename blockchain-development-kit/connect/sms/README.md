SMS Samples
===========
In many scenarios, particularly in emerging markets, the common denominator in terms of data acquisition and transmission is SMS messages.

Scenarios include  -
__Sending a message via SMS to a blockchain__. The message is used to initiate a contract or send a transaction.  The phone number of the individual is mapped to an identity that is used when submitting transactions to a blockchain.

__Sending a SMS message to a phone based on an event and/or change of state in a smart contract__.  In this case, an event has occured, e.g. a property on a contract has shifted to an "Out of Compliance" state that requires an SMS alert. 

__Two way communication between a party and the chain__.  This is a combination of inbound and outbound SMS messages tied to a transaction. This can also be used to collect a series of parameter inputs for a transaction and then send them all to a transaction on the blockchain.
