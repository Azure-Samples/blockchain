Internet of Things (IoT)
========================

There are scenarios where devices can provide valuable context from the sensors they contain.  For example, using temperature and humidity readings to determine if there is an issue with a cooler maintaining items that require refridgeration.

In other scenarios, the device is a vehicle which is engaging in transactions with third party devices. For example, a vehicle is interacting with a toll booth, charging station or a pump at a gas station.
