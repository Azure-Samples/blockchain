# Corda

[Corda](https://www.corda.net/) is an open source blockchain project, designed for business from the start. 
Only Corda allows you to build interoperable blockchain networks that transact in strict privacy. 
Corda's smart contract technology allows businesses to transact directly, with value.

# Azure 

This accelerator is designed to enable Corda applications to leverage the Azure Blockchain Development Toolkit.

It provides an ingress agent to send messages to the ledger via Service Bus and it also provides an egress agent that delivers messages from the ledger to Service Bus.  In both cases, the messages delivered are based on format used by Azure Blockchain Workbench to maximize compatibility with the Azure Blockchain Development Toolkit and other samples.

Shipped "in the box" is a Corda version of the Refrigerated Transportation contract which can bring together IoT, Corda, Office and SMS (via Twilio) in an end to end scenario to showcase the power of Corda + Azure.

This is the first of many samples for Corda for common scenarios that Microsoft will be co-developing with R3.
